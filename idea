Problem Statement: Efficient Document Search and Update System
Overview:
In today's digital era, organizations manage vast amounts of documents, often containing critical information that needs to be accessed and updated regularly. Searching through these documents and applying updates in real-time can be a time-consuming process if not optimized. This problem specifically deals with building a system capable of handling efficient document search and update functionalities.

Problem Description:
The goal is to develop a system that allows users to search for documents based on specific queries and update their content as needed. The key challenges are ensuring that searches return accurate results quickly, while updates are made seamlessly without compromising document integrity.

Challenges:
Document Search Efficiency:

The system needs to handle a large number of documents and support quick and accurate searches across various attributes (e.g., document title, content, metadata, etc.).

Users should be able to perform complex queries, such as searching for specific phrases, keywords, or document types, while maintaining speed and scalability.

Document Update Accuracy and Integrity:

Updates to documents must be performed reliably and without corrupting the original data.

Version control is necessary to track changes, ensuring that previous versions are preserved and retrievable in case of errors or rollback requirements.

User Interface:

The system should provide an intuitive user interface that allows users to efficiently search for documents and make updates without a steep learning curve.
